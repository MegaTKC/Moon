# Moon
A frontend with multiple proxies (coming soon) and enhancements so you can browse the web freely, without censorship or web filters imposed by the School (District) or workplace. 

## Proxies included
Below are the proxies currently included in Moon.

### Ultraviolet
Ultraviolet is a highly advanced proxy using service workers and TompHTTP. Created by TitaniumNetwork and offers regular updates as well as support for CAPTCHA and many of the most popular websites. (Instagram, YouTube, Discord, etc.) It could also get your system theme!

### Corrosion
Corrosion is a proxy designed by TitaniumNetwork which was succeeded by Ultraviolet and the successor to the Alloy proxy. Corrosion supports a large majority of websites, including YouTube (and YouTube Music), Soundcloud, and Coolmath Games!

## Libaries & Credits
Credits to `expressjs` for serving my static files. (HTML/CSS/JS)<br>
- `TitaniumNetwork` for creating Corrosion and Ultraviolet. (I basically just modified Ultraviolet-App, added Corrosion, add some stuffs and remove stuff I didn't want.)
- `@tomphttp/bare-server-node` Creating an interesting future for proxies because they have service workers.
