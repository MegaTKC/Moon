# I don't recommend using this anymore because it's no longer supported. This is the `legacy` code. Versions 0.0.2-3-alpha and under. The proxies work better in the `main` branch.

# Moon
A simple frontend (for now) used to evade web filters.

Currently the frontend has **Corrosion**, which was a proxy developed by TitaniumNetwork and the successor to the Alloy proxy. Corrosion's successor is Ultraviolet, which may be implemented along with other proxies in the future.
The frontend also has **Node-Unblocker**, which is a library by nfriedly and used to bypass web filters and internet censorship. It's still in development and you won't be able to access many sites just yet.

## Deployments

I don't recommend deploying it on platforms that don't allow proxies to be hosted on their service. 'Moon.' falls under this proxy category because it is powered by the multiple proxies.

The list below shows which hosting sites work if Moon is deployed onto it.
