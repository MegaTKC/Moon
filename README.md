# Moon
A simple frontend (for now) used to evade web filters.

Currently the proxy only has Corrosion, which was a proxy developed by TitaniumNetwork and the successor to the Alloy proxy. Corrosion's successor is Ultraviolet, which may be implemented along with other proxies in the future.

## Deployments

I don't recommend deploying it on platforms that don't allow proxies to be hosted on their service. 'Moon.' falls under this proxy category because it is powered by the Corrosion proxy.
